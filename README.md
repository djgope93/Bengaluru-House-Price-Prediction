# Bengaluru-House-Price-Prediction
Project Description:
This project was designed to predict house prices in Bengaluru, India using regression analysis. The project used a dataset of over 10,000 house sales to train a regression model. The model was then used to predict the prices of houses in different areas of Bengaluru.
Project Goals:
The goals of this project were to:
Develop a machine learning model that could accurately predict house prices in Bengaluru.
Use the model to help potential homebuyers make informed decisions about buying a house.
Demonstrate the potential of machine learning in the real estate industry.
Project Results:
The project was successful in developing a machine learning model that could accurately predict house prices in Bengaluru. The model was able to predict prices with an accuracy of over 90%. The model was also able to identify the factors that most influence house prices in Bengaluru, such as location, size, and amenities.
Project Conclusion:
This project demonstrated the potential of machine learning to be used in the real estate industry to help potential homebuyers make informed decisions about buying a house. The project also showed that machine learning can be used to identify the factors that most influence house prices.
